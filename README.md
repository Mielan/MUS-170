# MUS-170 Project 1 --Draft
## 💡 Inspiration:
Inspired from game music and ambient sounds, I am interested to explore how the ambient sounds are made. 

## 💻 What it does:
With a mixture of synthesized sounds (changed from the laugh and scream tracks) and recorded sounds, I aim to create a crowded fantasy travern environment including lute music, glass sound, dish sound, water pouring suond, crowd noise, and fireplace sound. I also experiment with left and right channels to have dish sound and glass sound be slightly left and right to try with create a more stereo environment. 

## 🔨 How I built it:
Experimenting and learning effects in Audacity, I recreate the lute sound from scream recording by first denoise the scream noise. I then extract part of the scream wav, use envelop tool to make the excerpt spindle shaped, and repeated it 22 times. After repeating, I then make it fade out and added reverb to simulate lute string getting quieter and being played in the room. Then, I am able to create octaves by changing pitchs. 

## 🧠 Challenges I ran into:
Learning Audacity from scratch is hard. I initially wanted to use Audition, but I found that Audacity is more suitable for my project since it is more straightforward in destructive editing. I also find simulating glass sound extremely hard.
