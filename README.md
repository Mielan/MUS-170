# MUS-170 Project 2 - DRAFT

## 💡 Inspiration:
This project is inspired by Final Fantasy music, especially the early pieces when Natsu uses 8-bit to compose sound tracks. The first motif gets inspiration from my project 1, the second motif gets inspiration frmo Final Fantasy battle theme, and the third motif gets inspiration from Pentatonic scale music.

## 💻 What it does:
The project consists of three tracks(motifs), each composed in REAPER and all instruments used are purly synthesized through Pure Data. Each motif consists of 4-6 various sounds and provides a interesting tone with combination of both higher and lower tones to express a rich feeling.

## 🔨 How I built it:
I mainly used moduulation, adsr, and inline in Pure Data. 

## 🧠 Challenges I ran into:
The greatest challenge is that after putting the sound recorded in from pure data into the reaper sample instrument, the tone changes drasticlly. This took me much time to experiment which sound I really want, and I have to go into reaper everytime to test the sounds.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
I love sound 2, sound 1, and the bubble sound. Especially sound 2, it give me a feeling of music instrument Yangqin. 

## 📖 What I learned:
By reading Designing sound by Andrew Fernell, I am amazed by how much pure data can do. I learned to look at spectrum, and use inline object to simulate sound. 

## 🚀 What's next for Project1:
Simulate more interesting sounds, and more motif.
Use the motifs in a game.

## Built With
