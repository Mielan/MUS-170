## 💡 Inspiration:
Inspired from game music and ambient sounds, I am interested to explore how the ambient sounds are made. 

## 💻 What it does:
With a mixture of synthesized sounds (changed from the laugh and scream tracks) and recorded sounds, I aim to create a crowded fantasy travern environment including lute music, glass sound, dish sound, water pouring suond, crowd noise (which did not work), and fireplace sound.

## 🔨 How I built it:
Experimenting and learning effects in Audacity, I recreate the lute sound from scream recording by first denoise the scream noise. I then extract part of the scream wav, use envelop tool to make the excerpt spindle shaped, and repeated it 22 times. After repeating, I then make it fade out and added reverb to simulate lute string getting quieter and being played in the room. Then, I am able to create octaves by changing pitchs. 
Then using virtual MIDI keyboard in REAPER, I was able to use my synthesized lute sound as a sample. The keyboard automatically generate the sample into half-pitches, and I was then able create a melody through keyboard. 

## 🧠 Challenges I ran into:
Learning Audacity from scratch is hard. I initially wanted to use Audition, but I found that Audacity is more suitable for my project since it is more straightforward in destructive editing. I also find simulating glass sound extremely hard.  
I also failed to use an actual MIDI keyboard--I ordered one keyboard online, but the shipping delayed. I had to change to use a virtual keyboard instead. 

## 🏅 Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
I am pretty glad that I was able to get the virtual MIDI keyboard working. Even though my created music piece is pretty simple, it is still a big step to me. 

## 📖 What I learned:
I learned to play around with Audacity and Reaper. Reaper is especially interesting to me. I also learned to manipulate sound in p5JS. 

## 🚀 What's next for Project1:
Experiment with 3D and Unity
