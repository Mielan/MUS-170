#X text 99 34 ADSR: attack-decay-sustain-release envelope;
#X text 340 77 Generate an attack/decay/sustain/release envelope shape.
Attack \, decay \, and release times are in seconds \, and the sustain
level is a percentage.;
#X text 337 145 The audio input is used as a trigger - when its sign
changes from negative (or zero) to positive the ADSR outputs an attack
segment (during which it ramps to one) folllowed by a decay segment
\, after which it comes to rest at the sustain level \, typically less
than or equal to one. When the trigger signal drops to zero or a negative
value \, the ADSR outputs its release segment \, ramping to zero.;
#X text 338 290 The "curveball" control causes the output to be in
quadratic segments instead of linear \, often suitable for controlling
an amplitude because it mimics "sones".;
