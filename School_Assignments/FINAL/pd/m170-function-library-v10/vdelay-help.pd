#X text 252 126 delays the incoming signal by a delay time in seconds.
The delay time entered in the number box is added to the right-hand
side input to compute the delay time to use. The left-hand input is
the signal to be delayed. In this example \, white noise is added to
a delayed copy of itself., f 43;
